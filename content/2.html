<br />
If you’ve ever wanted to teach your pup a fun trick, teaching them how to bow is an easy and fun way to do it! Bowing is a great way to show your dog’s obedience, and it can also be used to show your pup some love and affection. Here’s how to teach your pup how to bow.<br />
<br />
Start by standing in front of your pup and getting them to sit. Give them a treat, and then move your hand down towards the floor and say the command ‘bow’. As you do this, gently press down on your pup’s chest and hold it there for a few seconds. If they don’t bow down, you can give them a treat and try again.<br />
<br />
Once your pup starts to bow down, give them a treat and lots of praise. Repeat this process until your pup bows down without you needing to press down on their chest.<br />
<br />
Once your pup has learned the command, you can use it to show your pup affection. Whenever you want to give your pup a hug or kiss, just say ‘bow’ and they’ll be more than happy to oblige.<br />
<br />
Teaching your pup how to bow is a great way to show your pup some love and appreciation. It’s also a fun trick that your pup will love to show off!<br />
